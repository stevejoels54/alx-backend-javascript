# ES6 Data Manipulation

This project focuses on exploring various array and object manipulation techniques using ES6 features.

## Array Manipulation Techniques

### 1. Map

The `map()` method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.
### 2. Filter

The `filter()` method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a certain condition.

### 3. Reduce

The `reduce()` method is used to reduce the elements of an array to a single value by applying a function to each element.

### 4. Find

The `find()` method is used to find the first element in an array that satisfies a certain condition.

### 5. Some

The `some()` method is used to check if at least one element in an array satisfies a certain condition.

### 6. Every

The `every()` method is used to check if all elements in an array satisfy a certain condition.

### 7. Sort

The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of an array in place.

### 8. Includes

The `includes()` method is used to check if an array contains a certain element.

### 9. FindIndex

The `findIndex()` method is used to find the index of the first element in an array that satisfies a certain condition.

## Object Manipulation Techniques

### 1. Object.keys

The `Object.keys()` method is used to get an array of the keys of an object.

### 2. Object.values

The `Object.values()` method is used to get an array of the values of an object.

### 3. Object.entries

The `Object.entries()` method is used to get an array of key-value pairs of an object.

### 4. Object.assign

The `Object.assign()` method is used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

### 5. Object.freeze

The `Object.freeze()` method is used to freeze an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being modified or deleted.

### 6. Object.seal

The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being deleted, but still allowing existing properties to be modified.

### 7. Object.getOwnPropertyNames

The `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method is used to get an array of all property names (including non-enumerable properties) of an object.

### 8. Object.getPrototypeOf

The `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method is used to get the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of an object.

### 9. Object.setPrototypeOf

The `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method is used to set the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of an object.

### 10. Object.is

The `Object.is()` method is used to determine whether two values are the same value.

### 11. Object.getOwnPropertySymbols

The `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method is used to get an array of all symbol properties of an object.

### 12. Object.fromEntries

The `Object.fromEntries()` method is used to transform a list of key-value pairs into an object.

### 13. Object.values

The `Object.values()` method is used to get an array of the values of an object.

### 14. Object.entries

The `Object.entries()` method is used to get an array of key-value pairs of an object.

### 15. Object.assign

The `Object.assign()` method is used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

### 16. Object.freeze

The `Object.freeze()` method is used to freeze an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being modified or deleted.

### 17. Object.seal

The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being deleted, but still allowing existing properties to be modified.

### 18. Object.getOwnPropertyNames

The `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method is used to get an array of all property names (including non-enumerable properties) of an object.

### 19. Object.getPrototypeOf

The `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method is used to get the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of an object.

### 20. Object.setPrototypeOf

The `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method is used to set the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of an object.

### 21. Object.is

The `Object.is()` method is used to determine whether two values are the same value.

### 22. Object.getOwnPropertySymbols

The `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method is used to get an array of all symbol properties of an object.

### 23. Object.fromEntries

The `Object.fromEntries()` method is used to transform a list of key-value pairs into an object.
